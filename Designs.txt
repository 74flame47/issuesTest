Who/what/where/when/why/how


What?
I need to start coding but I'm not motivited to do so.

why not?
Because I haven't anchord my mind to inspire myself yet.

What do I need to do to anchor myself?
 Go through the 5W's& H.
Because if you was at work you would just have to toil. Don't work out of toil.



My heart rejoiced in all my labour.
Labor.









Now I need to map out the layout of everything.
Actually, I need to create a concept design of everything.]



















TO DOS:

    What's needed?
        +I need to create a reset function that resets everything when I submit the results.
            How do I reload the component?
            I need to move the array with the map code to a new component and load that in, then 
            change the array that I send to it. The array will reflect the state, and when the statechanges,
            the component will update too.
            Yeaaaahhhhh this should work.
            So I didn't do that but I fixed the code and left the notes in the code

            I need to conned it to the state, then make changes to the state.
        +I need to conditionally render the tiles to start the test along with the results.
        -What is the style I am going with for the results?
        -I need a starting tile and I want to show different images when the results are in.




count is 1-4 which is the questions positions

I am currently pushing new answers into the answer's array but not as an
tile answer array but as the answer itself.
The last tile needs a completed array that it can send and replace...
what needs to happen?

if there are 3 questions
check to see if any questions have a null
If they do, then do nothing
if they don't, then send answers array for the last tile.


What's happening
I need make changes to the tile answers when a question is clicked.
How is changes made to the tile's answers?
changeValue is called when question is clicked and if it's the last
tile. This changes the value of the question in it's position.


So I need to send an array of all the values when all the answers 
doesn't have a null.
What function does this?
sendAnswers!

sendAnswers suppose to send the final result.
So the problem is with send answers....
what is it doing?
When is it triggered?
