Who/what/where/when/why/how


What?
I need to start coding but I'm not motivited to do so.

why not?
Because I haven't anchord my mind to inspire myself yet.

What do I need to do to anchor myself?
 Go through the 5W's& H.
Because if you was at work you would just have to toil. Don't work out of toil.



My heart rejoiced in all my labour.
Labor.









Now I need to map out the layout of everything.
Actually, I need to create a concept design of everything.]
