Creating a react app:
    npm init react-app myapp
    This will create the app enviroment for me, next I will have to navigate to it
        in the terminal.

    ***[I notice an error keep popping up when doing this "Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing near '...nt-webpack-plugin":"0'"
    I googled the solution to this and it goes as follows {npm cache clean --force}. I don't know why it works but it works...]***



Git Notes:
    If you already have a project prepared you have to ensure a few things.
        1.It is using a package manager npm. You can do this by running {npm init}
        2.Git also have to be on it as well. You can do this by running {git init}
            a.Make sure that you add the "node_modules" folder is added to {.gitignore}
                (Just add the folder name within the file.)
            b.If you don't have a .gitignore, you can create one within Visual Studio Code. 
                (Just create a file and name it {.gitignore})

    Once you've ensured that these are present and functioning you can move on.

    Next you have to create a git respository on your git account.

    Once that is complete:

DNS Setup
    Once I bought the domain name from a DNS provider, they will give you DNS
        records for that domain name. My DNS provider is godaddy.
    I then headed over to netlify and added a domain name to my site. I copied
        their link they gave me for the site and added it to my DNS records @godaddy.
        "CNAME www @" to "CNAME www blah-blah-blah.netlify.app"
    The time frame for this is usually 24 hours but it went up in 5mins for me.
